Bay-breasted Warbler (Setophaga castanea),babwar,5.3.1 Logging and wood harvesting,1.1 Ecosystem conversion,Negative impact (Literature),The greatest threat to the breeding range of the Bay-breasted Warbler is the reduction in the area of old-growth spruce (Picea spp.) and fir (Abies spp.) of the boreal forest.  Both nesting habitat and food supply (spruce budworm) are at risk when reductions or alterations of these forest areas occurs (Niemi et al. 1998). ,"""Mayasich JM, Niemi GJ. 2003.

Bay-breasted Warbler (Setophaga castanea),babwar,5.3.1 Logging and wood harvesting,1.2 Ecosystem degradation,Negative impact (Literature),"Overall, our results indicate that forest degradation has led to habitat declines for the majority of forest bird species with negative consequences for bird populations, particularly species associated with older forest. Forest changes include conversion from mixed-species forests to single-species conifer-dominated plantations or thinnings (Fig. 1c,d,e) and clear-cutting old forests without equivalent regrowth into old age classes (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1). Notably, over the same time period, forest cover changed very little (Fig. 3a), and harvest practices in this region are considered sustainable from a wood-production standpoint30.

The habitat changes we observed were strongly associated with population size for most forest bird species in our study and appear to be driving population declines (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 8) in several species, including those associated with old forest (for example, bay-breasted warbler [Setophaga castanea], Blackburnian warbler, boreal chickadee, winter wren [Troglodytes hiemalis]).","""Betts MG, Yang Z, Hadley AS, Smith AC, Rousseau JS, Northrup JM, Nocera JJ, Gorelick N, Gerber BD. 2022.

Conversely, orange-crowned V. celata, palm D. palmarum, and Nashville V. ruficapilla warblers were found in young stands. 

The presence of several Neotropical migrants was associated with mixed-wood attributes (ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus with aspen, red-eyed vireo Vireo olivaceus with shrub alder, and Swainson’s thrush Catharus ustulatus with canopy white birch). 

Jack pine stands older than commercial rotation age must be maintained in a managed landscape because their bird communities differ from younger stands. Because of the limited avian diversity in pure jack pine stands, sufficient mixed-wood stands must be regenerated to sustain populations of characteristic bird species. We recommend that jack pine mixed-woods be managed using shelterwood or selective cuts, and that rotation age of some stands be increased. Without the extensive fires necessary for regeneration, cutting patterns at the landscape level should approximate natural disturbance patches both in size and frequency of disturbance.","""Kirk DA, Hobson KA. 2001.

Black-throated Blue Warbler (Setophaga caerulescens),btbwar,5.3.1 Logging and wood harvesting,1.2 Ecosystem degradation,Negative impact (Literature),"Overall, our results indicate that forest degradation has led to habitat declines for the majority of forest bird species with negative consequences for bird populations, particularly species associated with older forest.

Notably, over the same time period, forest cover changed very little (Fig. 3a), and harvest practices in this region are considered sustainable from a wood-production standpoint30.

The habitat changes we observed were strongly associated with population size for most forest bird species in our study and appear to be driving population declines (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 8) in several species, including those associated with old forest (for example, bay-breasted warbler [Setophaga castanea], Blackburnian warbler, boreal chickadee, winter wren [Troglodytes hiemalis]).","""Betts MG, Yang Z, Hadley AS, Smith AC, Rousseau JS, Northrup JM, Nocera JJ, Gorelick N, Gerber BD. 2022.

Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis),canwar,5.3.1 Logging and wood harvesting,1.2 Ecosystem degradation,Negative impact (Literature),"Overall, our results indicate that forest degradation has led to habitat declines for the majority of forest bird species with negative consequences for bird populations, particularly species associated with older forest. Forest changes include conversion from mixed-species forests to single-species conifer-dominated plantations or thinnings (Fig. 1c,d,e) and clear-cutting old forests without equivalent regrowth into old age classes (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1). Notably, over the same time period, forest cover changed very little (Fig. 3a), and harvest practices in this region are considered sustainable from a wood-production standpoint30.

The habitat changes we observed were strongly associated with population size for most forest bird species in our study and appear to be driving population declines (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 8) in several species, including those associated with old forest (for example, bay-breasted warbler [Setophaga castanea], Blackburnian warbler, boreal chickadee, winter wren [Troglodytes hiemalis]).","""Betts MG, Yang Z, Hadley AS, Smith AC, Rousseau JS, Northrup JM, Nocera JJ, Gorelick N, Gerber BD. 2022.

The presence of several Neotropical migrants was associated with mixed-wood attributes (ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus with aspen, red-eyed vireo Vireo olivaceus with shrub alder, and Swainson’s thrush Catharus ustulatus with canopy white birch). 

Jack pine stands older than commercial rotation age must be maintained in a managed landscape because their bird communities differ from younger stands. Because of the limited avian diversity in pure jack pine stands, sufficient mixed-wood stands must be regenerated to sustain populations of characteristic bird species. We recommend that jack pine mixed-woods be managed using shelterwood or selective cuts, and that rotation age of some stands be increased. Without the extensive fires necessary for regeneration, cutting patterns at the landscape level should approximate natural disturbance patches both in size and frequency of disturbance.","""Kirk DA, Hobson KA. 2001.

Chestnut-sided Warbler (Setophaga pensylvanica),chswar,5.3.1 Logging and wood harvesting,1.2 Ecosystem degradation,Negative impact (Literature),"Overall, our results indicate that forest degradation has led to habitat declines for the majority of forest bird species with negative consequences for bird populations, particularly species associated with older forest.

Notably, over the same time period, forest cover changed very little (Fig. 3a), and harvest practices in this region are considered sustainable from a wood-production standpoint30.

Chestnut-sided warbler density decreased with patch size, however nests were initiated earlier in larger patches. 

These results contrast with the results of studies of area sensitivity of mature forest and grassland birds, in which bird density is negatively related to patch area.

There is already a ""floater"" pool of non-territorial yearlings early in fall, and further habitat loss presumably would result in even fewer birds claiming winter territories (Stutchbury 1994). There is some evidence from other species that non-territorial individuals suffer a higher over-winter mortality rate (Rappole et al. 1989b), so one could predict an increased yearling mortality rate.

The presence of several Neotropical migrants was associated with mixed-wood attributes (ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus with aspen, red-eyed vireo Vireo olivaceus with shrub alder, and Swainson’s thrush Catharus ustulatus with canopy white birch). 

Jack pine stands older than commercial rotation age must be maintained in a managed landscape because their bird communities differ from younger stands. Because of the limited avian diversity in pure jack pine stands, sufficient mixed-wood stands must be regenerated to sustain populations of characteristic bird species. We recommend that jack pine mixed-woods be managed using shelterwood or selective cuts, and that rotation age of some stands be increased. Without the extensive fires necessary for regeneration, cutting patterns at the landscape level should approximate natural disturbance patches both in size and frequency of disturbance.","""Kirk DA, Hobson KA. 2001.

Conversely, orange-crowned V. celata, palm D. palmarum, and Nashville V. ruficapilla warblers were found in young stands. 

The presence of several Neotropical migrants was associated with mixed-wood attributes (ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus with aspen, red-eyed vireo Vireo olivaceus with shrub alder, and Swainson’s thrush Catharus ustulatus with canopy white birch). 

Jack pine stands older than commercial rotation age must be maintained in a managed landscape because their bird communities differ from younger stands. Because of the limited avian diversity in pure jack pine stands, sufficient mixed-wood stands must be regenerated to sustain populations of characteristic bird species. We recommend that jack pine mixed-woods be managed using shelterwood or selective cuts, and that rotation age of some stands be increased. Without the extensive fires necessary for regeneration, cutting patterns at the landscape level should approximate natural disturbance patches both in size and frequency of disturbance.","""Kirk DA, Hobson KA. 2001.

Jack pine stands older than commercial rotation age must be maintained in a managed landscape because their bird communities differ from younger stands. Because of the limited avian diversity in pure jack pine stands, sufficient mixed-wood stands must be regenerated to sustain populations of characteristic bird species. We recommend that jack pine mixed-woods be managed using shelterwood or selective cuts, and that rotation age of some stands be increased.

Yellow Warbler (Setophaga petechia),yelwar,5.3.1 Logging and wood harvesting,1.2 Ecosystem degradation,Negative impact (Literature),"Overall, our results indicate that forest degradation has led to habitat declines for the majority of forest bird species with negative consequences for bird populations, particularly species associated with older forest. Forest changes include conversion from mixed-species forests to single-species conifer-dominated plantations or thinnings (Fig. 1c,d,e) and clear-cutting old forests without equivalent regrowth into old age classes (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1). Notably, over the same time period, forest cover changed very little (Fig. 3a), and harvest practices in this region are considered sustainable from a wood-production standpoint30.

The habitat changes we observed were strongly associated with population size for most forest bird species in our study and appear to be driving population declines (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 8) in several species, including those associated with old forest (for example, bay-breasted warbler [Setophaga castanea], Blackburnian warbler, boreal chickadee, winter wren [Troglodytes hiemalis]).","""Betts MG, Yang Z, Hadley AS, Smith AC, Rousseau JS, Northrup JM, Nocera JJ, Gorelick N, Gerber BD. 2022.

Yellow-rumped Warbler (Setophaga coronata),yerwar,5.3.1 Logging and wood harvesting,1.2 Ecosystem degradation,Negative impact (Literature),"Overall, our results indicate that forest degradation has led to habitat declines for the majority of forest bird species with negative consequences for bird populations, particularly species associated with older forest. Forest changes include conversion from mixed-species forests to single-species conifer-dominated plantations or thinnings (Fig. 1c,d,e) and clear-cutting old forests without equivalent regrowth into old age classes (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1). Notably, over the same time period, forest cover changed very little (Fig. 3a), and harvest practices in this region are considered sustainable from a wood-production standpoint30.

The habitat changes we observed were strongly associated with population size for most forest bird species in our study and appear to be driving population declines (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 8) in several species, including those associated with old forest (for example, bay-breasted warbler [Setophaga castanea], Blackburnian warbler, boreal chickadee, winter wren [Troglodytes hiemalis]).","""Betts MG, Yang Z, Hadley AS, Smith AC, Rousseau JS, Northrup JM, Nocera JJ, Gorelick N, Gerber BD. 2022.
